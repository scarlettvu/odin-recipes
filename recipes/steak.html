<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup high-quality root beer</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons steak sauce (such as Heinz 57®)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon onion salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
    <li>4 (6 ounce) rib-eye steaks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Stir the canola oil, root beer, Worcestershire sauce, teriyaki sauce, steak sauce, garlic salt, onion salt, black pepper, basil, thyme, and rosemary together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Pierce the steaks in several places on both sides; arrange in a single layer in a shallow non-reactive dish. Pour the marinade over the steaks, flipping the meat to coat both sides. Allow to marinate in refrigerator 3 to 4 hours, flipping meat once halfway through.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Remove the steaks from the marinade and shake off excess moisture; discard the remaining marinade.</li>
    <li>Cook the steaks until they are beginning to firm, and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium.</li>
