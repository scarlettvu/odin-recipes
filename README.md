# odin-recipes
A simple HTML project where I put my HTML knowledge to practice to build a basic recipe website. This website is purely done in HTML and does not include CSS or Javascript. Some of the basic web development/HTML concepts that I applied to this project include elements, tags, boilerplate, texts, headings, lists, links, images, git basics, and commit messages.
